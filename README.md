## Which seems better for creating the elements of the app: JS alone or JS with React?

Creating reusable components, using JS/React and JSX is easier to work with. Since most of the components on Wordle are repetive (multiple tile boxes, keyboard keys, etc) being able to define a component and pass props through it to render and evaluate differently makes sense for a UI like Wordle. Working with JSX too is accessible because it looks similar to HTML so you have a better idea of the page structure you're building.
